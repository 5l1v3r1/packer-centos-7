# Packer Build - CentOS 7 minimal Vagrant Box

**DEPRECATED**: This Packer build has been moved to a new consolidated project: https://github.com/geerlingguy/packer-boxes

The public box is still available and updated on Vagrant Cloud: [`geerlingguy/centos7`](https://app.vagrantup.com/geerlingguy/boxes/centos7), but the build configuration has been moved to the consolidated project.
